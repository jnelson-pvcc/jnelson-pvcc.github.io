      <h1>How Should the Internet be Monitored and Regulated?<h1>
      <div class="innerDisc">
      <p>To understand how or why the internet could or should be monitored and regulated, it is first important to understand the fundamentals of the internet itself. The internet is, in the most simple terms, a “global network”. To elaborate, it is a network connecting billions of computers to each other and allowing the global importing and exporting of information. When you connect to Wi-Fi to perform a google search or access academic resources through your college’s webpage, you are utilizing the internet in order to access the world wide web. In this digital age, people and companies store personal information; social security, bank information, identification, etc… all of which can be stored safely within a computer or online, but there are always vulnerabilities. In the beginning of May, 2000, a college student named Onel de Guzman created a program for his undergraduate thesis paper, a type of malware known as a “worm” which he explained could be used to remotely gain the passwords of people in neighboring areas (Computer Museum of America, 2022). When his professors denied his thesis, citing it as criminal, Guzman left the college and continued to work on his program, until one night he removed the location based restrictions and released it globally. This malware is known today as the “ILOVEYOU” virus and it caused millions if not billions in damages and served as a catalyst for improvements in cybersecurity, even gaining the acknowledgement of the American government. It is unlikely that a virus like this could or will ever come about again due to how advanced the systems monitoring your internet usage have become. Modern firewalls and antivirus softwares are constantly watching and doing local scans, stopping you from downloading potentially harmful files and limiting active threats. With the sheer size and capabilities of the internet, it is important that there are protocols and laws in place to regulate and monitor a vast sea of information, otherwise, who knows what could happen?<p>
