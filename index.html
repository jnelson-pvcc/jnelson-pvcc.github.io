      <h1>How Should the Internet be Monitored and Regulated?<h1>
      <div class="innerDisc">
      <p>To understand how or why the internet could or should be monitored and regulated, it is first important to understand the fundamentals of the internet itself. The internet is, in the most simple terms, a “global network”. To elaborate, it is a network connecting billions of computers to each other and allowing the global importing and exporting of information. When you connect to Wi-Fi to perform a google search or access academic resources through your college’s webpage, you are utilizing the internet in order to access the world wide web. In this digital age, people and companies store personal information; social security, bank information, identification, etc… all of which can be stored safely within a computer or online, but there are always vulnerabilities. In the beginning of May, 2000, a college student named Onel de Guzman created a program for his undergraduate thesis paper, a type of malware known as a “worm” which he explained could be used to remotely gain the passwords of people in neighboring areas (Computer Museum of America, 2022). When his professors denied his thesis, citing it as criminal, Guzman left the college and continued to work on his program, until one night he removed the location based restrictions and released it globally. This malware is known today as the “ILOVEYOU” virus and it caused millions if not billions in damages and served as a catalyst for improvements in cybersecurity, even gaining the acknowledgement of the American government. It is unlikely that a virus like this could or will ever come about again due to how advanced the systems monitoring your internet usage have become. Modern firewalls and antivirus softwares are constantly watching and doing local scans, stopping you from downloading potentially harmful files and limiting active threats. With the sheer size and capabilities of the internet, it is important that there are protocols and laws in place to regulate and monitor a vast sea of information, otherwise, who knows what could happen?<p>

  <h1>By Whom? And to What Extent?<h1>
    <div class="innerDisc">
    <p>There is no question of should the internet be regulated, because it already is. Every website you visit is identified by a unique IP (internet protocol) address that allows the website to communicate with your client to send data and information to each other. Why is it then, that every website can be mainly identified with an easily memorizable link such as “google.com”? This is known as the Domain Name System (DNS) which allows for a computer to translate the domain name string back into the identifiable IP address, allowing the user to enter an easy to remember string of letters and numbers, while the computer receives something it can understand (IONOS, 2022). Of course, with the ability to give names to your websites, there needs to be some sort of authoritative entity to regulate the process of accrediting and distributing domains. This is where the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) comes in. ICANN is a non-profit corporation that basically acts as an administrator to the marketing of domain names. The organization does not actually control the market, they simply organize connections between “registrars” being individual companies that hold the rights to TLDs (Top Level Domains, such as .com, etc…). They accredit the registrars and draw contracts, essentially acting as a coordinator for the supply of domains (ICANN, n.d). This system of controlling the identifying “names” of each website is one of the most fundamental ways in which the internet is regulated. However, it is also a form of regulation that doesn’t have much effect on how ordinary users operate their devices using the internet. There have been attempts at internet regulation in the past that were much more restrictive; aimed at changing how people operate on the web. Net neutrality is one of the most important pieces of regulation around the internet. It is a standard that ensures the fair treatment of all data by Internet Service Providers (ISPs, think Verizon, Comcast, or AT&T); essentially ISPs cannot prioritize or throttle data under incentives (Federal Communications Commission, n.d). Back in 2014 Verizon launched a lawsuit against the FCC pushing back on their net neutrality standards. During this time, many internet users were up in arms, signing petitions and protesting, calling to “#SaveNetNeutrality”. The D.C Circuit Court ruled on behalf of Verizon in this case, prohibiting the FCC to act as a regulative authority over net neutrality, which many considered to be the death of net neutrality as a whole (Justia, 2014). Net neutrality still exists today, but not without many attempts at destroying it. It is not, however, about the final rulings, but the reaction from the people. To many, this was the line at which internet regulation had gone too far, when their ability to freely surf the web went into jeopardy.<p>

  <h1>A Short Conclusion<h1>
  	<div class="innerDisc">
    <p>The internet has undergone many changes since it's inception. Many might think,"I miss the old days", but it is certainly for the better that changes have been made to increase the monitoring and regulation of the internet. And to give a conclusive answer, yes. The internet should be monitored and regulated. There should be strong, well-backed authorities such as non-profits and governmental agencies regulating the internet and the extent of their regulation should be to make the internet a safer and more free place to travel, not to restrict the freedoms of users.<p>
